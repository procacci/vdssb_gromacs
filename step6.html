<h2> Step 6:  Calculation of dissociation free energy </h2>

In the previous <a href="step5.html"> Step 5 <a>, we have generated
in <i> each </i> of the 384 bound folders
(<code>3clp_HREM_OUT/fsdam/b</code><i>i</i>, with 1 < i < 384) and
in <i> each </i> of the 192 the unbound folders
(<code>LIG_only_ligand_HREM_OUT/fsdam/u</code><i>i</i>, with 1< i
<192) two <code>dhdl.xvg</code> files, namely <code>dhdlQ.xvg</code>
and <code>dhdlvdw.xvg</code>, relative to electrostatic and LJ
ligand-environment interactions, respectively.<br>
      
These files are processed to obtain the absolute dissociation free
energy using the
script <a href="works_bash.html"><code>works.bash</code> </a> which returns
4 estimates for the ligand-receptor dissociation free energy: 3
estimates are based
on <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4918558"> Gaussian
mixtures </a> (one, two and three components) and the Jarzynski
estimate.<br> 

untar the <a href="6_bin.tar.gz">bin<a/> archive in the parent
directory (<code>USER_SCRATCH</code>) where you copied the bound and
      unbound dir directories (see step 3), and do
      <pre>
	cd USER_SCRATCH
	cd bin/em
	make
	</pre>
jump back to the parent directory USER_SCRATCH and launch from this directory the
works.bash script as
      <pre>
	bin/works.bash PF-3clpro 
     </pre>	
      PF-3clpro is the user-defined name for the project. the output
      of the program should be the following
<pre>
lj bound done
qq bound done
lj unbound done
qq unbound done
 DG1= 2.0  2.2 DG2=  1.5  4.5 DG3=  3.9  4.7 DGj=  8.6  0.9
</pre><br>

The last line  refer to the four estimates of the dissociation free energy
(in kcal/mol) for the complex PF-3CLpro (the second numer is the 95% confidence
interval). The first three estimates, <code> DG1, DG2, DG3</code> have
been computed using the <code>em</code> program (based on the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1135"> Expectation Maximization
algorithm </a>) where the bound and unbound vDSSB convolution work
distribution have been fitted using Gaussian mixtures with 1 to 3
components. The large confidence interval for these EM-based estimate denotes
poor fitting suggesting that the convolution work distribution is
likely to be due to <a href="work.BU.jpg"> >3 </a> Gaussian components. The last
numbers (8.6 0.9) refers to the Jarzynski estimate, which is
asymptotically exact and is taken as the <b> more reliable estimate </b> in the
  present case.
  The script generates in a subdirectory <code>Results</code> a series of <a href="6_files.tar.gz"> files </a> with the basename <code>PF-3clpro</code>
  containing the salient processed data for the PF-3CLpro example.<br><br>

      To calculate the volume correction to dissociation free energy,
the script <a href="VOLcor_bash.html"> <code>VOLcor.bash</code></a> can be 
used. It acts on the <code>pullx.xvg</code> files
(see <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5139374"> Zenodo <a/>
repository) generated in target state replica of each BATTERY of the
bound state. For the PF-3CLpro complex the correction should be equal
to -2.8 kcal/mol. In the SI.zip attached to the JCIM note we also
include the <code>script Qcor.sh</code> for the finite-size correction
applying to charged ligands. Such correction dose not apply to
PF-3CLpro as the ligand bears no net charge. For further technical details on the usage of these scripts
see the README files in the <code>6_post</code> directory of the
SI.zip archive attached to the JCIM note.
