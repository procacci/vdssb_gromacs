# Step 1: Docking (local)
<p style="text-align:justify"> This is a tutorial for the calculation of absolute dissociation free energy between PF-07321332 and 3CL<sup>pro</sup>.
The methodology is divided into six consecutive steps. For each step, we report the computational details. The major massively parallel
  computational step consists in the HREM simulations (Step 3) and in fast switching alchemical simulations (Step 5). The Steps 1, 2 and 4
  are fast preparatory automatized procedures for running the two major computational jobs on the HPC. The last Step 6 is the automatized 
  post-processing of the vDSSB data. A description of the procedure can be find in the paper .....  Full output data for the application 
  PF-07321332-3CL<sup>pro</sup> can be found on the Zenodo repository (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5139374"> https://zenodo.org/record/5139374 </a>).</p> <br>
